The user selects the desired experience and preferred location in the application's search engine. The experience can be hobbies, sports, professional activities, but the intention is to make it possible for almost anything and anyone.

Example: Experience Location
Surf Indonesia
Mountain biking France
Research Burundi
Erasmus Stockholm
Traveling with a dog Lisbon

The user chooses the match that they most identify with among several options.
Example:
User X is a 32-year-old Portuguese who chooses surfing in Sydney as their experience. They match with User Y, a 29-year-old Australian who chooses surfing in Ericeira, Portugal as their experience.

After a match, they establish contact through social media or the application's chat feature to plan their joint experience.
Example:
User X: "It would be ideal for you to come to Ericeira in February because you'll catch the perfect swell, and I have availability to take you to the best spots."

User Y: "Great! I have full availability in February. I'll check on SuperAppy the best way to streamline the trip! And when are you coming to experience the amazing waves in Sydney?"

User X: "We can plan my trip when you're here, and you don't need to bring a surfboard because I understand the hassle it can cause. You'll have access to my surfboards!"

Optimizing the experience:

After the ideal match, the application provides tools that allow the user to optimize, plan, and budget their experience with the goal of reducing costs. SuperAppy offers a set of ad values to the user.

Ad values:

Trip plan: Allows users to plan their trips down to the smallest detail and minimize costs. The fact that they are paired with an ideal match enables users to have the knowledge of a local resident and take advantage of all the benefits, as well as experience the local culture more intensely.
Example: Diana from New York, a 56-year-old doctor, matches with Hassan, a doctor from Burundi. Diana is a researcher studying the genetics of a bat species found only in the forests of Burundi, and Hassan wants to deepen his knowledge in hospital management in the United States. How could Diana better conduct her research in the middle of the Burundian forest without the help of a local doctor? The same goes for Hassan.

Share your place: Enables users to share spaces by creating a sharing space to offer to their matches. This minimizes the cost of accommodation for User Y and brings more recognition and added value for future matches for User X.
To develop the described application, you would need a software development team that includes front-end developers, back-end developers, UX/UI designers, and testers. Here are some steps you can follow to start developing the application:

Define the system requirements: Before starting the development, you need to clearly define all the system requirements, including the features to be provided, the target users, the user interface, and the basic functionality of the application.

Create a wireframe: Next, you should create a wireframe of the user interface. This helps visualize how users will interact with the application and how it should be designed to provide a seamless user experience.

Develop the back-end: Now it's time to create the business logic of the application. You will need to create a database to store user information and matches, as well as develop a matching algorithm to help users find their ideal match based on their preferences.

Develop the front-end: After completing the back-end, you will need to develop the user i
